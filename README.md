## Guide line
* Using 
	* camelCase
	* english / explicits names
	* scss
	* functions

* merge request only on **experimental** branch

* Always work with the **[index-list](https://github.com/Estelle111/clicker-project/blob/experimental/index-list.md)**
  For each ID, class, function, variable,... creation => add it on INDEX-LIST

* Watch the [todo list](https://github.com/Estelle111/clicker-project/projects/1) regularly and modify it if necessary

* To link scss to css use the link **sh linkScss.sh** 

* 3 meetings / day

## Tasks assignment
**Scrum master** : **Estelle**
* communication management within the team
* smooth project and timing
* README.md

**Product checker** : **Maxime**
* features pusher

**Corrector** : **Alexandre**
* master branch management
* code checking of everyone to improve them if necessary

**Testers** : **Matthieu** & **Magid**
* bugs management

**Indexer** : **Maxime**
* index-list creation and management
 

## Built With
* HTML
* SCSS
* CSS
* Javascript

## Workflow

- We worked each of us on a different branche called by our respective names.
- At each new feature, or major update done, we merged our personal branche to a common one, called 'experimental' (usualy called 'development'). The conflicts had to be resolved at that time.
- Finally, the corrector checked the code, and merged 'experimental' on the master branch.

## Sprint
* **Sprint 1**
	* Organization of the planning.
	* Distribution of roles.
	* Initialization of the repo on github.
	* Basic structure of html, scss and javascript files.
	* JS preparation: 
		* game object constructor and object. 
		* score and multiply properties.
* **Sprint 2**
	* No credit : When you click the button, increase the score property, and then display that score in the div display.
	* Meter display : Display the multiplier counter inside the button.
	* Price display and multiplier : Display the multiplier counter inside the button. 
	* Price evolution and multiplier : The more you buy multipliers, the more expensive they are.
	* Increase of the score compared to the number of clicks.
	* Prepare and use of the multiplier : Add a button whose identifier is multiply. Create a click counter on this button.The score increase by clicking the button integrates the multiplier value.
	* Purchase of banana (decrease in score)
	* Deduction of the score according to the purchase of bananas

* **Sprint 3**
	* Autoclick : As soon as you have a score of 20, one click is done automatically every second.
	* Purchase autoclick : After a score of 20, the autoclick is no longer automatic, you have to buy it.
	* Disable buttons when there are not enough bananas to buy them.
	* Bonus
	* Random time prototype on bonus

## Challenges

* Work with objects - This has been a first time for some of us.

* The NO-IMAGE rule has been a true challenge. To achieve our initial visual objective, we attempted to create visual elements with HTML and CSS.  

* Work in a group ! It required a lot of communication and organization. We also decided to dispatch the tasks as equally as possible in order to let everyone progress and not lean on each person's own proficiency.
